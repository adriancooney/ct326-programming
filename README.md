# Programming III Assignments.
Code in `/src`. Each assignment has it's own package (e.g. Assignment 1 in com.labs.one) unless the assignment requires
you to edit a previous Assignment (as in the case with Assignment 2). Each package will have it's own Main class (unless
specified otherwise by the assignment) which is the main entry point for the program.
